# DrinksSearch

Personal project developed for studying - and search drinks hehe.

This projetc uses:
 
  - the TheCocktailDB's Api to get all the infos about the drinks.
  - Axios to fecth/get all the data.
  - React to create the front-end.
     - react-router-dom@6 to make all the routes.
     - react context.api to turn states acessibles from other components.

## Implementations to be done:

 - Put an ErrorPage (already created) in case there are no drinks that match the name searched.
 - Put measure for all the ingredients into the Recipe component.
